			<a class="resource" href="resources/vm.html">Virtual Machines</a>
			 (VMs) are software-based emulations of physical computers that run an operating system (OS) and applications just like a physical machine. VMs allow multiple virtualized operating systems to coexist and run on a single physical host machine simultaneously. Each VM operates independently and has its own virtual hardware resources, such as CPU, memory, disk space, and network interfaces.

			<a class="resource" href="resources/basic_commands.html">Basic Commands</a> The command-line interface (CLI) is a text-based interface that allows users to interact with a computer's operating system or applications by typing commands in a terminal or command prompt. The command-line interface provides a way to control the computer and execute various tasks using text commands rather than a graphical user interface (GUI).
